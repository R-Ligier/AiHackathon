# AiHackathon Project - MTAlerts
Website where the user can schedule reminders/alarms for their most commonly used subway lines. 
In addition, we were working on allowing users to also take photos of subway stops/lines or anythng related to the subway line and a schedule with the stops at times for your current location would show up. The recognition software that was going to be used for this implemetation is Clarafi.
