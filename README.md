# AiHackathon Project - MTAlerts
Website where the user can schedule reminders/alarms for their most commonly used subway lines. They can receive these reminders via phone call, text, or alert.
In addition, we were working on allowing users to also take photos of subway stops/lines or anythng related to the subway line and a schedule with the stops and times for your current location would appear. The recognition software that was going to be used for this implemetation is Clarafi.
